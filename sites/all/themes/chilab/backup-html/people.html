                    David Yaghmourian is a staff research assistant at the Chi Learning and Cognition Lab. He graduated from ASU in May of 2014 with a B.Sc. in psychology and a minor in sociology. He started working in the lab in 2012 as an undergraduate research assistant,
                    and applied quantitative coding and analyses to help explain why observing a video of a tutor and tutee can be more effective for learning than observing a didactic monologue.

                <p>Na is a post doc at the Chi Learning and Cognition Lab. She received her PhD from Teachers College, Columbia University with Dr. John Black. Na’s research interests include science education, conceptual change and complex systems thinking. Past
                    work has been focused on designing simulation-based learning environment and instructional scaffolding in teaching secondary-level science. Currently, she has been focusing on interventions that can help people learn emergent concepts and reduce
